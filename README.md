# SoaringHeightsProduction
A static website for a freelance photographer/artist focused on displaying a portfolio and storefront. 

All web technologies including domain name, server hosting, and website building was done on [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) by the owner.

Originally, the project was made solely by the owner until Alyssa Chiego's services were then requested. The website is still undergoing changes and improvements, but website maintainence and updates are monitored by both the owner and Alyssa Chiego as business partners.

The online portfolio can be viewed [here](https://www.soaringheight.com/).
